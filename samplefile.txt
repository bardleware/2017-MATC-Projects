I am planning on getting a new computer soon. I am leaning towards a dell xps 15 or
a dell 7569. Tim pointed out something that I had not thought of before: that I could
use a mac to remote into it from a client using, RealVNC,so I would be able to program in macOS
instead of having to buy a new macbook.

This would meet all of my needs for computing.
